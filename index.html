            <p>Welcome to our interactive dashboard exploring Victoria's journey towards sustainable resource management. This visualization tool provides insights into the state's electricity and water consumption patterns across various suburbs and regions.</p>
            <p>By analyzing this data, we can identify areas of high consumption, track progress in conservation efforts, and make informed decisions for a more sustainable future. Explore the visualizations below to discover how different regions compare in their resource usage and learn about the factors influencing these patterns.</p>

            <h2>Victoria's Consumption of Electricity</h2>
            <p>Electricity is provided to Victoria in many different formats, however it is also interesting to compare how different areas of Melbourne and Victoria consume that energy. Different areas of Victoria have different reasons to consume electricity, either through their phone, or for work wether that is on a computer or powering machinery.</p>
            <p>The next section will evaluate the different regions of Melbourne, specifically the different Statisical Areas (Level 2), and how each of them compare in their electricity consumpion and production</p>

              <p>The visualisation above shows each level 2 area and displays the average kilo watts an hour the area consumes. Additionally this visualisation also allows us to gain a greater perspective to the amount of infrastructure that is established to ensure consistant power. </p>
              <p>An interesting comparison through this graph we can accurately see that the highest power consumption is Toorak, however the second highest is Emerald, which despite not being as wealthy, it does make up for size which means more people consume smaller amounts, leading to a highetened power consumption.</p>
