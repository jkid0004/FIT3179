                  <p>Welcome to our interactive dashboard exploring Victoria's journey towards sustainable resource management. This visualization tool provides insights into the state's electricity and water consumption patterns across various suburbs and regions.</p>
                  <p>By analyzing this data, we can identify areas of high consumption, track progress in conservation efforts, and make informed decisions for a more sustainable future. Explore the visualizations below to discover how different regions compare in their resource usage and learn about the factors influencing these patterns.</p>
