              <h2>Victoria's Resource Management Story</h2>
              <p>The visualisations in this project explore various aspects of resource consumption and management across Melbourne and Victoria. These graphs focus on electricity and water usage, comparing different Statistical Areas (SA2) and suburbs. The data presented offers insights into how consumption patterns differ across regions, particularly highlighting areas with high usage and exploring potential reasons behind these patterns, such as population density and lifestyle factors. Additionally, comparisons are drawn between electricity consumption and generation, renewable energy usage, and water consumption across different regions, emphasizing sustainability efforts.</p>

              <h2>Victoria's Consumption of Electricity</h2>
              <p>Electricity is provided to Victoria in many different formats, however it is also interesting to compare how different areas of Melbourne and Victoria consume that energy. Different areas of Victoria have different reasons to consume electricity, either through their phone, or for work wether that is on a computer or powering machinery.</p>
              <p>The next section will evaluate the different regions of Melbourne, specifically the different Statisical Areas (Level 2), and how each of them compare in their electricity consumpion and production</p>

                <p>The visualisation above shows each level 2 area and displays the average kilo watts an hour the area consumes. Additionally this visualisation also allows us to gain a greater perspective to the amount of infrastructure that is established to ensure consistant power. </p>
                <p>An interesting comparison through this graph we can accurately see that the highest power consumption is Toorak, however the second highest is Emerald, which despite not being as wealthy, it does make up for size which means more people consume smaller amounts, leading to a highetened power consumption.</p>

                <p>The visualization compares population density with energy consumption and generation in different SA2 regions for 2023. It highlights how areas with higher population density, such as Inner Melbourne, tend to have higher energy consumption, while regions like Northern Melbourne show the highest energy generation, illustrating the distinct energy dynamics across different suburbs.</p>
                <p>An interesting comparison to note is that more urban regions inside of Melbourne tend to have a higher population density, but have a lower mean electricity total. This could be because of the maintance of good energy practices, whilst more rural regions tend to have higher energy usage.</p>

              <p>By analyzing this data, we can evaluate the need for sustainable energy sources throughout Victoria and how Victoria and it's regions are progressing to remove the need for other energy sources such as Coal, Gas and Oil.</p>

                <p>This graph compares water consumption and electricity consumption across Melbourne suburbs, segmented by region. It reveals that suburbs with higher water consumption, like Northern Melbourne's Templestowe and Kalkallo, also tend to have elevated water usage, while areas like Toorak in Inner Melbourne consume an increased amount of water and more electricity overall.</p>
                <p> The data suggests a correlation between these utilities, where suburban regions may consume more water and electricity due to larger household sizes or lifestyle factors, while denser areas like Inner Melbourne prioritize higher electricity usage over water.</p>
